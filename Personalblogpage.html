        <h6>Short Bio: Growing up, I never really believed that I could cook. All I knew how to make growing up was spaghetti, hot dogs, basic tacos and fried chicken.
           Most of the time I would buy food for myself rather than cook. When I got married, my husband showed appreciation for the basic meals that I made for him and 
           that is what inspired me to learn more about cooking. Then I realized I really liked doing it. Over the next few years, I started learning different recipes 
           to cook for my family and I started getting better and better. I began to believe that I could cook. If I followed a recipe, I could spin it in my own direction 
           and customize it to my own taste.
          One day in 2021, my husband was making red beans and rice and I realized there was no cornbread to go with it. I decided to make some cornbread, but then I also realized
          "why not record this process and post it on Tik Tok"? Once I posted the video on Tik Tok, not thinking many people would view it, in total, it got almost 500,000
          views! With all of the positive comments that kept coming in, I decided to post other easy recipes I like to make for myself or my family. 
          The best part about the recipes are that ANYONE can do it! I even teach my 10 and 11 year old daughters how to cook! My goal is to inspire people to believe they can cook. 
          All it takes is a recipe and a little faith and anything can be possible.  </h6>
